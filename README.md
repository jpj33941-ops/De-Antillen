The Last Cat of De Antillen Roblox 

De Antillen used to be loud in the way Roblox worlds are loud—music looping badly, avatars jumping for no reason, markets full of fake gold and real laughter. In the middle of it lived a cat. No name worth remembering. Gray fur, torn ear, always watching from rooftops like the world might fall apart if it blinked.

Then came Nestenes.

He didn’t arrive with an army. He didn’t need one. He arrived with obsession. The kind that rots a person from the inside and convinces them that ruining things is the same as meaning something.

Nestenes hated De Antillen because it existed without him.

He tore it down with his own hands—brick by brick, code by code, screaming into the void while the world lagged and cracked. Towers collapsed. Spawn points died. NPCs froze mid-sentence forever. Players logged out and never came back. The sky glitched into a permanent red dusk, like the place itself was bleeding out.

The cat watched.

It didn’t understand terrorism. It understood fear. It understood that every time Nestenes laughed, something warm disappeared. Homes gone. Streets erased. History wiped like it was trash.

Nestenes didn’t stop because he was tired. He stopped because there was nothing left to hurt.

De Antillen became a dead server. An empty map. Wind sounds playing for no one.

The cat was still there.

It walked through the ruins, stepping over broken signs and half-loaded textures. It slept where the palace used to be. It waited for players who would never spawn again.

And Nestenes?

He stood alone, surrounded by nothing, finally exposed for what he was: not powerful, not legendary—just a small, vicious person who needed destruction to feel real. No crowd. No applause. Just silence judging him harder than any enemy ever could.

The cat stared at him once. Long. Calm. Like it understood something he never would.

Then it walked away.

Because even in a ruined world, the worst thing wasn’t the destruction.

It was the man who chose to enjoy it.
